# Impact_of_severe_weather_events_USA_1950-2011---Reproducible_Research
This brief report is examining the most damaging types of weather events in terms of fatalities and economic impact throughout the USA from 1950 to 2011. Severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern. This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.
